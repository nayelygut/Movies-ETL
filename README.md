# Movies-ETL

The goal of this project was to extract movie data from wikipedia and kaggle, clean it, and then load it onto a SQL database. The movie information will be used for a hackaton, with the challenge being participants create an algorithm to predict which low budget movies will be popular. In this project I used the python, pandas, and SQL.
